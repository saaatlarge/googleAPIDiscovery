# Google API Discovery

A video (https://youtu.be/RceZbtuZt5k) looking at how the Google API discovery works. 
Supporting files are:
some curl commands that can be issued
some PHP that extracts the method calls from the discovery document for a specific API (in this case drive)
a CSV of an extract from the JSON of the APIs available
